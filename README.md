# Project 4: Around The U.S.

This is a fun project showing an example of a social media like profile page. I used JavaScript to program the "edit" button to have an edit page pop up so that the user can change their profile bio. 

I have my project published here --->   https://katelinfrancois.github.io/web_project_4/
